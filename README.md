# Apigee Service Callout Policy

The Apigee Service Callout policy is a powerful tool provided by the Apigee API management platform to enable you to make outbound HTTP requests from within an API proxy flow. It allows you to integrate with external services, fetch data, and perform actions that enrich the functionality of your API.

## Usage
To include the Apigee Service Callout policy:

- Configure properties like target endpoint, HTTP method, payload transformation, timeouts, retries, and error handling.

- Invoke the policy within the API proxy flow to make an outbound HTTP request. Access the response data for further operations.

## Examples
**Basic Service Callout:**

Make a simple GET request to an external service and include the response in the API proxy flow.

```
<ServiceCallout name="MakeExternalRequest">
  <Endpoint>https://api.example.com/endpoint</Endpoint>
  <HTTPTargetConnection>
    <URL>https://api.example.com/endpoint</URL>
    <HTTPMethod>GET</HTTPMethod>
  </HTTPTargetConnection>
</ServiceCallout>
```
**Service Callout with Response Transformation:**

Make a POST request to an external service, transform the request payload, and extract specific data from the response.

```
<ServiceCallout name="TransformAndExtract">
  <Endpoint>https://api.example.com/endpoint</Endpoint>
  <HTTPTargetConnection>
    <URL>https://api.example.com/endpoint</URL>
    <HTTPMethod>POST</HTTPMethod>
  </HTTPTargetConnection>
  <Request>
    <Set>
      <!-- Add payload transformation here -->
    </Set>
  </Request>
</ServiceCallout>
```

For advanced features, such as payload transformation, conditional execution, timeouts, and security settings, refer to the official documentation.

## Conclusion
The Apigee Service Callout policy empowers API proxies to interact with external services efficiently. By leveraging its capabilities, you can seamlessly integrate with external systems and enhance the functionality of your APIs.
